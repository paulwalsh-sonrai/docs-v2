### Single-Sign-On and Password Policies

Jira Service Desk is a cloud service provided by Atlassian. Sonrai Security does not manage the password policy for it and can not setup SSO for this portal. 

If your organization requires SSO configuration or alternative password policy requirements for this portal, Atlassian provides corresponding documentation on how to configure it for your organization:
- [Single-Sign-On](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/saml-single-sign-on-943953302.html)
- [Password Policy](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/password-policies-938859739.html)
