## SSO Requirements 

### Supported Authentication Platforms

#### SAML 

By way of Auth0, Sonrai's authentication service supports a number of external SSO environments including generic SAML authentication for:
  - Okta
  - PingFed
  - Azure AD / ADFS
  - Google Workspace (G Suite)  


### Service Provider (SP) Initiated Logins Only

Sonrai currently only supports SP (service provider) authentication, so users must navigate to https://app.sonraisecurity.com/ to initiate a login and are then directed to their SSO platform for authentication. 

:::info
Granular control of identities via SSO is limited to integrations through AWS Identity Center. IdP-initiated sessions, such as launching an application icon from Azure Apps & Okta, are not currently. supported
:::


### Authentication Only

Users who can authenticate into your SSO service must still be created as a user (with assigned permissions) in Sonrai, before they can login to Sonrai. 


### Valid Email Addresses in Authentication Service

A valid email address is required in the login session details via a field named “email”. (This is generally a standard field, but SSO configurations should ensure to include this field).  

:::info
Users who are added/invited to Sonrai are invited by their corporate email address and this field should align with the address used in the invitation.

## Enabling SSO

When enabling SSO for authentication, the following settings are provided by Sonrai to your SSO team to enable the service:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Setting Name</th>
<th>Value/Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>SSO Connection Name</td>
<td>The convention for connection name is your Sonrai tenant name + Sonrai + SSO.<br/>Example: <code>ACMESonraiSSO</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Entity ID</td>
<td><code>urn:auth0:sonraisecurity:MyCorpSonraiSSO</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Assertion Consumer Service Callback URL</td>
<td><code>https://login.sonraisecurity.com/login/callback?connection=ACMESonraiSSO</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>SSO Signing Certificate</td>
<td>Outgoing authentication requests are <a href="/img/manage/users/sonraisecurity.pem">signed by this certificate.</a></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
In return, the following is required by Sonrai from your SSO team:<br/>
<br/>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Setting Name</th>
<th>Value/Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Sign In URL</td>
<td>The login address of your SSO service</td></tr>
<tr><td>Signout URL</td>
<td>(Optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>X.509 Certificate</td>
<td>From the SSO platform (often included in the metadata xml file export)</td></tr>
<tr><td>IdP Domains</td>
<td>The email address domains that should redirect to your SSO platform, such as <code>sonraisecurity.com</code> or <code>yourcompany.tld</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Field/Assertion</td>
<td>The field <code>email</code> must be <b>included</b> and it must match the email address that was used to invite the user to Sonrai</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


:::info
Upon navigating to https://app.sonraisecurity.com to login via SSO for the first time, a number of users have voiced that after authenticating in SSO they are returned to the main login form. (This occasionally happens when your SSO and internal auth user are combined).

Generally speaking, waiting a minute and attempting to log in again fixes the issue.

<p><b>Q: If we use SSO, is the Sonrai MFA still in effect?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: When SSO is enabled, the sonrai-internal MFA is disabled and all authentication is managed by the SSO service, including password strength requirements & MFA. Your users will only be prompted for MFA on through your SSO service. </p>

<div className="bluecard" style={{'height': '100%'}}>
<p><b>Q: Does Sonrai provide SSO only enforcement, ie. can not bypass with local authentication</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: SSO for Sonrai is mapped by email domain, like “example.com”. When SSO is configured, all users from that domain are forced to use SSO, and local authentication is no longer available. In the event of an SSO platform failure or outage, those users will not be able to login to Sonrai until the SSO configuration is disabled upon request from the customer.</p>

<p><b>Q: We are using Okta for our SSO IDP, but after adding the “email” attribute, we’re still not able to login?</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>: Okta supports using either <code>Profile Editor</code> or <code>SAML Integration / Attribute Statements</code> for the addition of attributes. You must use <code>SAML Integration/Attribute Statements</code> option for adding the <code>email</code> address field to your SAML configuration. Using “<b>Profile Editor</b>” does not properly encode the additional field.</p>
