## Overview 

The Sonrai platform provides Role Based Access (RBAC) to support the needs of a wide variety of users and public cloud security use cases. 

RBAC capabilities enable you to manage your users within the platform along with their role assignments (and corresponding permissions).

A Sonrai role determines which capabilities a user has access to within the Cloud Permissions Firewall.

---

## Role Administration 

Roles are managed by selecting <button>Manage Roles</button> within the **User Profile**.

To manage roles, users must have an appropriate level of permissions to manage roles and permissions (i.e., "**Cloud Permissions Firewall Administrator**" role).

## Roles - Detailed Permissions

To review a list of the specific permissions granted to each role, use the following query in the [Advanced Search](https://app.sonraisecurity.com/App/GraphExplorer) area:

<div className="grid-container">

```graphql title="Example Query" showLineNumbers
query SonraiRoleDetails {
  SonraiRoles {
    count
    items {
      name

# Optionally return users for each role 
      roleAssignments {
        count

## Default RBAC User Permissions 

For reference, the Sonrai platform requires specific user permissions to work properly out-of-the box, and so the following are assigned to every user by default: 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Permission</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>Role,<br/>Read</code></td><td>Ability to read Role elements</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>UserToken,<br/>Read</code></td><td>Ability to read User Token elements</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
