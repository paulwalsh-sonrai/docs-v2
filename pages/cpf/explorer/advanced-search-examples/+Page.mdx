title: Advanced Search Examples

---



## Overview

The Sonrai [Advanced search](https://app.sonraisecurity.com/App/GraphExplorer) supports access to the full GraphQL query language, providing for the  ability to build more complex query logic than with the more basic [UI-based search](https://app.sonraisecurity.com/App/Search).  

Auto-complete is enabled in this UI to assist in building searches and the Docs Explorer pane is avilable for looking through API schema details. 

### Advanced Search Syntax Pointers

**Values Filter Option**

When using `op: [OPERATOR] values: [ … ]` filters, the “values” filter option only works with `op: IN_LIST` and `op: NOT_IN_LIST` tests. If you attempt to use it with other operators, such as `CONTAINS`, the filter is **not** activated and will not be applied to your query.

**Limits and Offsets**

The default number of items returned for queries varies, based on the query at hand (Example: Some are limited to returning 100 results, while others may return 25). To return more [or less] results for your search query, you can leverage `limits` and `offsets`. 

By changing the offset value, you can effectively page through sets of results, like below:
- Page 1: ```items(limit:1000 offset 0 orderBy: {title: {order: ASC} }))```
- Page 2: ```items(limit:1000 offset 1000 orderBy: {title: {order: ASC} }))```
- Page 3: ```items(limit:1000 offset 2000 orderBy: {title: {order: ASC} }))```

:::tip 
Sorting by ascending will ensure the same ordering of data is returned when asking for the next offset in the iteration (otherwise the data returned could be duplicated/missing in relation to the first offset).

## List of Saved Searches 

This query will return a list of the defined searches:

```graphql title="Example Query" showLineNumbers
query AdvancedSearches {
  SavedQueries 
  (where: {
    # add a string to the value below to search for a specific matching name
    name: {op: CONTAINS value: ""}
  })
  {
    count
    items {
      name
      srn
      # optionally include the GraphQL query, as well
    }
  }
}
```

## Saving Advanced Searches

Saving an Advanced Search allows you to create complex queries and save them to be used at a later date.

To save a search, add a parameter called `saveQuery`, providing a name and other options:

```graphql title="Example Query" showLineNumbers
 query sonrai_user_activity { SonraiAuditLogs
   saveQuery: {name: "userLoginsSearch" overwriteExisting: true execute: false}
  	( where: {
        fromDate: { value: "2023-12-01"}
        toDate: { value: "2024-01-01"}
        eventName: {value: "UserLogin"}
     })
  {
  	count
    items {
      createdDate
      eventName
      actor { name }
      message
    }
	}
}
```

  <div className="bluecard">
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <p>
        <li><b>Include the</b> <code>saveQuery</code> <b>line twice</b>; once <i>as a comment</i> and once <i>without the comment</i>.<br/> The <code>saveQuery</code> line does not get saved with the search, so by adding the line a second time as a comment the details are kept with the search.     
        If further changes to the search are required, copy/paste the comment keeping the same name for the search.   </li>
        <li><b>Include</b> <code>overwriteExisting: true</code>, to allow the existing query to be overwritten.</li> <br/>
        <li><b>Include</b> <code>execute: false</code>, to remove the [sometimes lengthy] requirement to wait until query completion before the search is saved.</li>
      </p>
  </div>

## Deleting Advanced Searches

To delete a saved search, the SRN of the saved search must first be obtained: 

```graphql title="Example Query" showLineNumbers
query searches {
  SavedQueries
  (where: { name: { op: CONTAINS, value: "<searchName>" caseSensitive:false } }) 
  {
    items  {
      name
      srn
    }
  }
}
```

Use the SRN of the saved search within the deletion mutation:

```graphql title="Example Mutation" showLineNumbers
mutation deleteQuery {
  DeleteSavedquery (srn:"<srn of the search>")
}
```
