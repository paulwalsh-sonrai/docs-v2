## Overview

The Reporting section provides an overview of exceptions/exemptions that have been implemented for specific accounts (authorized users, break glass accounts, etc.) and a detailed audit log tracking user interactions with the Cloud Protection Firewall.

## Exception List 

Exemptions will be made for identities within your organization which require continued access to sensitive permissions, and those exempted identities will be listed for reference on this Reporting page.

Some of these identity exemptions will be facilitated through the Services slide-in panel for a specific service/account, while other exemptions will be made through Permissions on Demand (POD) requests. 

The roll-up widgets provide metrics for top trending POD requests (involved user, service, scope) and request approvals versus denies. 


### Sensitive Permissions Identity Exemptions 

When you protect a service, you can add exemptions to each account in scope to ensure no disruption in operations occurs. The most common use case(s) include machine identities used to deploy infrastructure or break glass identities.

## Detailed Audit Log 

Along with stating the action that occurred, the user that performed the action, the scope at which the action was performed, and the date and time at which the action occurred is present for each table row to provide you with a contextual timeline of events.

When viewing the audit log, below are some inclusions you may encounter: 

| Action | Description |
| -- | -- | 
| `CreateControlMapping` |  A service has been protected or disabled |
| `DeleteControlMapping` |  A service has been unprotected | 
| `AddExceptionIdentity` | An identity has been exempted from a service protection | 
| `RemoveExceptionIdentity` | A previously exempted identity has been removed from a protected service exemptions list | 
| `SubmitControls` | The "Pending Changes" are translated to the CloudFormation template (`json` file) | 

The time range can be changed using the filter in the top right hand corner to quickly narrow down results.
