## Permissions on Demand (POD) Requests

The "**Requests**" page table view provides information on each Permissions on Demand request made by users. 

A user's view of this page will differ based on the scope at which they are granted to authorize Requests (i.e. Org level, OU, account).

## Approving & Denying POD Requests



### Actioning Requests 

Once you click the link you have received within the email, your view will transfer to the Cloud Permissions Firewall (CPF) UI > Requests page with that request in focus.

Generally speaking, there are two actions: 
- **Approve**: Review and confirm the requester is authorized to use the requested sensitive permission(s) 
- **Deny**: Review and deny the user access to the sensitive permission(s) 

Both actions require a message containing context/justification for approval/denial of the request.
